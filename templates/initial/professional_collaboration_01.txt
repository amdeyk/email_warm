Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across your work in [Industry/Field] and was impressed by [Specific Achievement].

I believe there might be an interesting opportunity for collaboration that could benefit both our organizations. Would you be open to a brief discussion?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
